  <h1>Agent B</h1>

  <p>This banana can be found running around the streets of Montana in a suit. He is from a top secret organization called <span class="redacted">PIB</span> which stands for <span class="redacted">Produce</span> <span class="redacted">in</span> <span class="redacted">Black</span>.
  </p>
  
  <p>He is extremely rare to find and is not to be goofed around with. Their HQ is at <span class="redacted">Lewis</span> <span class="redacted">and</span> <span class="redacted">Clark</span> <span class="redacted">Library</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>He can be seen with a partner. We suspect they are together. They might have special tech such as ray guns, and working jet packs.
  </p>
  
  <p>Agent B stands out very well because he is a banana and is yellow, but they are extremely good at blending in. We will try to watch him, but he is above the system.</p>
  
  <p>We have no idea who is the leader of the <span class="redacted">PIB</span>. We will put up pictures that we can find of them.</p>

<p>There is not much known about Agent P, formerly known as <span class="redacted">Pickle</span> <span class="redacted">Rickle</span>. He became partners with <span class="redacted">Agent B</span> and then founded <span class="redacted">PIB</span>. Then they made it big and then made weapons that no one has seen before.
</p>

<p>Their headquarters was recently blown up while working on a case, and no one knows about anything else.</p>
